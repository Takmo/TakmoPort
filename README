TakmoPort - A Teleporting Plugin

- Introduction -

Quite a long time ago, I sat down one weekend and hacked together a teleportation
plugin named ModePoints. I started off wanting to simplify teleportation, and,
in retrospect, I actually made it MORE difficult. Not entirely happy with that
attempt and still a bit unhappy about current teleportation methods, I'm starting
on a new project, named TakmoPort, which will hopefully be an improvement from
the original plugin.

This project is currently in development, so do not expect it to be ready soon.
It will be ready when it's ready. That's about all I can say.

I will be uploading my progress here as I work on the project. Unless otherwise
stated, all code here is released subject to the zlib/libpng license.

The rest of this text consists of my attempt to explain what the plugin should
do and how it will work.

- Ideas -

TakmoPort would consist of two types of entities: Waypoints and Teleporters.
A teleporter serves as the sending location of a teleport.
A waypoint serves as the receiving location of a teleport.
Teleporters are linked to specific waypoints.
Standing in a teleporter for 3 seconds will teleport you to the asigned waypoint.
If a teleporter needs a key, you must be HOLDING the correct key in your hand.

Each teleporter and waypoint is marked by a single block (type specified in config)
that serves as the base. A player using a teleport must be standing on/above the
teleporter base within 3 blocks on the Y-axis. When a player is teleported to a
waypoint, they will automatically be elevated to the next free space above the base.

To create a waypoint, use the /waypoint command and click the desired base block.
The syntax is as follows:

/waypoint [name - required] [key - default false] [permission.node]

The name is required to create a waypoint, and must be unique from existing waypoints.
The key option defaults to false, but if passed true, the key required is the item
you are currently holding (nothing is a valid key.) The final option, the permission
node, allows you to specify the required permission a player must possess to be
teleported to this waypoint. Not required by default, but may be useful for admins.

To create a teleporter, use the /teleporter command and click the desired base block.
The syntax is as follows:

/teleporter [waypoint - optional]

When creating a teleporter with a destination waypoint, the teleporter will automatically
be set to teleport to a specific waypoint. By omitting the waypoint option, you create
a temporary teleporter.

Temporary teleporters have no waypoint by default and will not teleport unless focused.
These teleporters can be useful as a public teleporter allowing you to teleport to any
number of waypoints rather than being limited to a single one. In order to teleport
using a temporary teleporter, you must focus the teleporter on the desired waypoint
before stepping into it. After focusing, the teleporter acts as any normal teleporter.
When a player has been teleported, the teleporter reverts back to its original unfocused
state.
To focus, use the following command and click the base block.

/focus [waypoint - required]

To delete a waypoint or teleporter, simply destroy the base block and the entity will be
unregistered. By default, anyone is able to use and destroy teleporters, so it may be
useful to use an ownership plugin such as LWC alongside TakmoPort.

To determine the destination or name of a teleporter/waypoint, use the /tpinfo command
and click the base block. This will list the current desination waypoint for teleporters
and the name and required key for waypoints.
